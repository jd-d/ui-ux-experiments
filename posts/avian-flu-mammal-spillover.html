            <h2>Current situation</h2><p>The H5N1 avian influenza virus continues to circulate widely in birds and is increasingly spilling over into mammals. This 2.3.4.4b clade virus has caused unusual die-offs in species like <strong>foxes, sea lions, mink, and cats</strong>, indicating it can infect mammals more easily than earlier strains. For example, in 2025 the virus was detected in dozens of cats across multiple US states (likely from eating infected wild birds). On the human side, a handful of isolated <strong>human cases</strong> have been reported in the last two years – in Asia, Europe, and the Americas – almost all in people who had close contact with sick poultry (e.g. poultry farm workers or people handling infected birds). Crucially, there is <strong>no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission</strong> so far.</p><h3>Why it matters</h3><ul><li><strong>Pandemic potential:</strong> H5N1’s continued circulation and mutation increase the chances it could adapt to spread efficiently among humans. While the virus has not achieved that, each mammal infection is essentially another “trial run” that could yield a more human-compatible strain. The global community remembers that the 1918 flu pandemic likely had avian origins, hence the heavy vigilance.</li><li><strong>Economic impacts:</strong> Even without a human pandemic, H5N1 is wreaking havoc on poultry industries – tens of millions of birds have died or been culled. This affects poultry prices and farmer livelihoods. Additionally, responses to human cases (like quarantines or culling) carry economic and social costs.</li><li><strong>Public health readiness:</strong> This situation is a live test of pandemic preparedness. Vaccines for H5N1 are being updated, and some countries have stockpiles. The WHO has a system for sharing flu virus samples and would call an international alert if certain clusters or mutations appear. So far, that trigger hasn’t been hit.</li></ul><h3>Watch next</h3><ul><li><em>Genetic red flags:</em> Scientists worldwide are sequencing H5N1 from outbreaks. Particular mutations – such as changes in the HA protein that improve binding to human-type receptors, or PB2 mutations that help the virus replicate in mammalian lungs – would be warning signs. Any report of such mutations spreading would raise the risk level.</li><li><em>Human clusters:</em> If you see 2 or more human cases in close proximity in time and place (other than family exposure to the same birds), that could indicate human-to-human transmission. For example, if hospital workers with no bird contact start testing positive, that would ring alarm bells.</li><li><em>Animal surveillance:</em> Beyond poultry, continued unusual deaths among wild mammals or in domestic animals (like dogs or cats) should be monitored. A wider range of mammals infected means more chances for the virus to adapt; notably, a mink farm outbreak in 2022 showed some mammal-to-mammal spread, which was concerning to researchers.</li></ul><small>Sources: <a href='https://www.who.int/emergencies/disease-outbreak-news'>WHO Disease Outbreak News</a>; <a href='https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary'>CDC Avian Flu Summary</a></small>
